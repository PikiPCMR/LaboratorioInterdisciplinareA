# LaboratorioInterdisciplinareA
Hi guys!
this is the first project by us, created to pass an exam for the university.
we have to develop a climate monitoring software, that able people to see and (if registered)
manage and add new climate locations.
We wish that this project will provide new skills for the next projects.
